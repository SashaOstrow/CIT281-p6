    -Have fun creating a client-server web application that interests you!!!

# Overview

For this project, you get to create a client-server web application of your choice that satisfies the project requirements.

This project focuses on practicing full-stack development, including server-side routing, client-side files, and version control with GitHub.

The way this code is constructed is meant to test out how to use server with public folders like index, script, and style. By doing this I build code inside of the server that has GET, POST, PUT and DELETE which communicates with the public files that let me decorate and construct the website into whatever I want. I did this by allowing the user to add or unadd any words they please into an item object that gets displayed. The way the code is meant to work is you put whatever word you want displayed into the white box, and then once you click the button it will be pushed to output the word that got entered. After that, you will see the word is now underneath the title “History List” which now the client can decide to either keep the word displayed, delete it or keep adding more words to the list.
